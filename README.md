# ðŸŽ“ Course: "Python Developer. Intensive" â€” SkillFactory (2022)

In 2022, I completed an intensive online course in Python development offered by SkillFactory. Over the course of three months, I studied both fundamental and advanced topics and worked on several hands-on projects.

âœ… What I learned:
Confident programming in Python: syntax, functions, OOP, file handling, exceptions

Practical experience with libraries and tools: requests, re, unittest, asyncio, sqlite3, psycopg2, and more

Web development with Django

Building RESTful APIs, working with databases, handling forms, and implementing user authentication

Containerizing applications using Docker

Writing unit tests and collaborating using Git and GitHub

ðŸ›  Projects and practice:
Throughout the course, I completed 50+ coding exercises and developed several projects, including:

A Telegram bot built with Python

A Django-based web app (e.g., a classifieds board)

A final project: a full REST API with database integration and user authentication

Small games and CLI tools like Tic-Tac-Toe and Battleship

ðŸš€ Outcome:
Acquired solid backend development skills with Python

Built a portfolio of practical projects (some available on my GitHub)

Gained confidence to tackle real-world development tasks
